# Interactive Brainfuck Interpreter in React TS

This is an interactive interpreter for the brainfuck programming language.  
It provides simple brainfuck execution, along with a view of the memory, the memory pointer, the current state of the
code and more.

It is great for debugging brainfuck programs, including a memory view, program view, the location of the pointers, the
ability to directly edit memory.  
You can step manually through the program, or set the execution speed to whatever speed fits best.   
This interpreter also has the ability to set breakpoints using the â€¢ symbol. This means you can let your code run fast and
stopping it at any point in your program to see what went wrong.

## Features
* brainfuck execution including IO
* memory view
* code state view
* manual stepping
* breakpoints
* error messages
* seeing ASCII characters in memory
* manual code input

### Future features
* fast excecution mode (no debugging info)
* better speed control
* (limited) backstepping
